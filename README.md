# twitter-reply-bot
Twitter Search and Reply Bot written in Python

Requires a Twitter Developer account.

Working as of June 2022.

Use case:

I have personally used this bot to reply to every tweet relating to a company with a message informing fans that if they make their first purchase using my referral link, they will be discounted 10% off. Each time my referral link was used my account was credited with $10.
My girlfriend is very happy with her free makeup.
