Twitter Search and Reply Bot written in Python

- Enter your search term where directed.
- Alter how often you wish to reply to new tweets (in the last line)

I have personally used to reply to every tweet relating to a company with a message of telling fans to make their first purchase using my referal link for 10% off. Each time my referral link was used my account was credited with $10. If you choose to do this, I would recommend first blocking the company otherwise they may delete your account as was threatened to me.
